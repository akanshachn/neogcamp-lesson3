                <p class="zero-margin card-para">
                    Teaching in a government school was not the job my parents & I thought it would be! It was draining
                    - emotionally, mentally and physically. I decided that I wanted to leave, but I had no idea what I
                    would do if I left. My brother, who is a software engineer himself, encouraged me to try my hand at
                    coding again. Over the course of the next few months, I started relearning how to code and convinced
                    my parents to support my decision as well.

                <p class="zero-margin card-para">
                    Being a caretaker for my mother left me with a lot of time in between tasks. With my parents'
                    encouragement, I started preparing for government teacher's exams, and cleared it in the first
                    attempt. I joined a Delhi government school in November, 2019.

                    In late 2018, I joined a full-time position in the same company where I interned. However, due to an
                    accidental injury, my mother's health declined in March 2019 and I made the tough decision of
                    quitting my job immediately, to take care of her.

                    It was during my first internship in the last semester of Post Graduation, that I truly come to love
                    the world of coding. I learned a lot about the corporate world and work from a great team, met my
                    best friend too!
